- Regularization for Linear and Logistic Regression can be used to obtain better parameter W for the functions. The data can be found in the ex2data.csv
- Handwritten Recognition 0_1 used a simple NN to recognize the handwritten digit between 0 and 1. The data can be found in the X.ipy and y.ipy
- Handwritten Recognition 0_9 used a simple NN to recognize the handwritten digit between 0 and 9 using softmax and ReLU activation function. The data can be found in the Label.ipy and PixelMap.ipy
- Customer Segmentation is the project where I use kmean clustering to separate segment of people (including examples of good 3d plotting). The data can be found in the segmented_customers.csv
- Recommender System (Collaborative Filtering) with Movies ratings implement a recommender system with collaborative filtering. The data can be found in Recommender CF data folder
